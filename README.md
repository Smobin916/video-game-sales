# Video Game Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing video game sales data to identify factors influencing the success of a game. By leveraging data exploration and visualization techniques, the goal is to uncover actionable insights that can help plan advertising campaigns and predict future game successes. The dataset includes information on game names, platforms, release years, genres, sales across regions, critic scores, user scores, and ESRB ratings.

## Features
- **Data Validation**: Checking for data consistency and completeness to ensure accuracy.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Identifying patterns and trends in sales data.
  - Examining correlations between critic/user scores and game success.
  - Visualizing sales distributions by genre, platform, and region.
- **Statistical Testing**:
  - Hypothesis testing on platform performance and genre popularity.
  - Evaluating regional sales variations and user preferences.

## Tools and Techniques
1. **Pandas**: Efficient manipulation and preprocessing of data.
2. **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Creating insightful and visually appealing visualizations.
3. **Statistical Methods**:
   - T-tests for comparing average ratings and sales metrics.
   - Correlation analysis to identify impactful factors.
4. **Machine Learning**:
   - Models for predicting sales trends (optional, based on project scope).
